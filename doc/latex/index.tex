This flash utility can be used to flash a new ROM.\+BIN into ROM banks of the COMMANDER X16. ~\newline
 Because the ROM.\+BIN is a significantly large binary, ROM flashing will only be possible using the SD CARD. Therefore, this utility follows a simple and lean upload and flashing design, keeping it as simple as possible. The utility program is to be place onto a folder of the SD card, together with the ROM.\+BIN. The user can then simply load the program and run it from the SD card folder to flash the ROM.

Embedded in the source code is the technical documentation how the ROM flash works. The main principles of ROM flashing is to {\bfseries{unlock the ROM}} for flashing following pre-\/defined read/write sequences ~\newline
 defined by the manufacturer of the chip. Once these sequences have been correctly initiated, a byte can be written at the specified ROM address. And this is where it gets tricky and interesting concerning the COMMANDER X16 ~\newline
 address bus and architecture. ~\newline
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{ROM Adressing}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
The address bus of the ROM chips follow 19 bit wide addressing mode. ~\newline
 As you know, the COMMANDER X16 has 32 banks ROM of 16KB each. ~\newline
 The COMMANDER X16 implements a banking solution to address these 19 bits, where the most significant 5 bits of the 19 bit address are configured through zero page \$01, configuring one of the 32 ROM banks, while the main address bus is used to addresses the remaining 14 bits of the 19 bit ROM address.

This results in the following architecture, where this flashing program uses a combination of setting the ROM bank and the main address bus to select the 19 bit ROM address.

 There is also one important caveat to keep in mind at all times ... What does the 6502 CPU see? ~\newline
 So, the CPU uses zero page \$01 to set the banks, but the lower 14 bit ROM address for the CPU starts at \$\+C000 and ends at \$\+FFFF (16KB), as the CPU has a 16 bit address bus. So the lower 14 bits of the ROM address requires to be added with \$\+C000.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Flasing the ROM}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
ROM flashing is done by executing specific write sequences at specific addresses with specific bytes into the ROM. Depending on the write sequence, a specific ROM flashing function is selected. ~\newline


This utility uses the following ROM flashing sequences\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Reading the ROM manufacturer and device ID information.
\item Clearing a ROM sector (filling with FF). Each ROM sector is 1KB wide.
\item Flashing the cleared ROM sector with the new ROM bytes.
\end{DoxyItemize}

That\textquotesingle{}s it. However, there is more to that ...\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{ROM flashing approach}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
The ROM flashing requires a specific approach, as you need to keep in mind that while flashing ROM, there is {\bfseries{no ROM available}}! This utility flashes the ROM in four steps\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Read the complete ROM.\+BIN file from the SD card into (banked) RAM.
\item Flash the ROM from (banked) RAM.
\item Verify that the ROM has been correctly flashed (still TODO).
\item Reset and reboot the COMMANDER X16 using the new ROM state.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

During and after ROM flash (from step 2), there cannot be any user interaction anymore and all interrupts must be disabled! The screen writing that you see during flashing is executed directly from the program into the VERA, as no ROM screen IO functions can be used anymore.
